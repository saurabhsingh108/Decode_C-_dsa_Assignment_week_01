"Only two of them are right."



Reasons-

First option is incorrect since a variable name cannot start with a number.

2nd option is correct because a variable name can start with underscore.
3rd option is incorrect as a variable name because int is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as a
variable name.
4th option is still correct because C++ is a case sensitive language. Here FLOAT and float are treated
differently therefore FLOAT is not a reserved keyword hence can be used as variable name.
Last option is incorrect because no variable can have spaces in between.
